## Algorithm Animator
I built this interactive visualization tool while learning frontend development. It combines my journey into JavaScript DOM manipulation with understanding core algorithms.

## What it does
- Generates random arrays and sorts them visually
- Shows step-by-step with color-coded comparisons and swaps
- Currently has Bubble, Selection, and Insertion sorts
- will add merge & quick sorts 

## Why I built it
I was learning algorithms but couldn't visualize what was happening in the code. 
Building this animator helped me understand the logic while practicing my frontend skills at the same time.

## Tech
This project helped me practice:
- JavaScript DOM manipulation and event handling
- CSS animations and responsive design
- Async/await for controlling animation timing
- Building interactive web applications from scratch
